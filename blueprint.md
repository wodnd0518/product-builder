# Product Builder Blueprint

## Overview

A content-rich website centered around a synonym quiz game, designed to meet Google AdSense approval criteria by providing valuable, high-quality content for users interested in language and vocabulary.

## Features & Design

### Implemented

*   **Core Application:** An "Odd One Out" synonym quiz game.
*   **Theming:** Dark and light mode toggle.
*   **Monetization:** Basic Google AdSense integration (scripts and ads.txt).
*   **Contact:** A Formspree-powered contact form.

### Current Plan: AdSense Approval Optimization

*   **Goal:** Transform the website into a high-quality, content-rich resource to ensure Google AdSense approval.
*   **Strategy:** Address the "Insufficient Content" rejection reason by adding unique, valuable, and well-structured content and creating a complete, professional user experience.

*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Create Essential Static Pages:**
        *   `privacy.html`: Generate and add a comprehensive Privacy Policy page, a key requirement for AdSense.
        *   `about.html`: Create an "About Us" page to explain the site's purpose and build trust and legitimacy.

    2.  **Add High-Quality Content:**
        *   **"Word of the Day" Section:** Add a new section to the main page (`index.html`) to feature a "Word of the Day" with its definition and an example sentence.
        *   **Articles/Blog:**
            *   Create an `articles.html` page to serve as a blog/article index.
            *   Write and add 2-3 unique articles related to vocabulary and language learning to establish the site as a valuable resource. (e.g., `article-1.html`, `article-2.html`).

    3.  **Improve Navigation & Site Structure:**
        *   **Header Navigation:** Update the main navigation bar to include links to Home, About, Articles, and Contact.
        *   **Footer Navigation:** Implement a consistent site-wide footer on all pages (`index.html`, `contact.html`, `about.html`, `privacy.html`, `articles.html`, etc.) containing links to Home, About, Privacy Policy, and Contact.

    4.  **Enhance Existing Pages:**
        *   Add more descriptive text to the `index.html` homepage to better explain the quiz and its benefits for users.

    5.  **Styling:**
        *   Create styles for all new elements (articles, footer, etc.) to ensure a polished and professional appearance.

## Deployment

*   **Repository:** `https://github.com/wodnd0518/product-builder.git`
*   **Action:** Push the final code to the `main` branch after all optimization steps are complete.
