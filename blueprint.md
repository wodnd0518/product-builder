# Product Builder Blueprint

## Overview

A "Odd One Out" synonym quiz game with a contact form for partnership inquiries. The user is presented with a set of words and must select the one that doesn't fit with the others. The application tracks the user's history and score.

## Features & Design

### Implemented

*   **Quiz Logic:** Presents questions from a predefined set.
*   **Interactive UI:** Users can select answers and progress through the quiz.
*   **History Tracking:** Displays a history of answered questions and their correctness.
*   **Scoring:** Calculates and displays the final score.
*   **Styling:** A visually appealing "glassmorphism" theme with dark and light modes.
*   **Theme Toggle:** A button to switch between dark and light modes, with the preference saved in `localStorage`.

### Current Plan: Partnership Inquiry Form

*   **Goal:** Create a simple contact form using Formspree to receive partnership inquiries.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new `contact.html` page for the form.
    2.  Add a navigation link to the contact page from the main quiz page (`index.html`).
    3.  Build the HTML form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.
    4.  Configure the form to submit to a placeholder Formspree URL.
    5.  Create a `contact.css` file to style the new page.

## Deployment

*   **Repository:** `https://github.com/wodnd0518/product-builder.git`
*   **Action:** Push the final code to the `main` branch.
